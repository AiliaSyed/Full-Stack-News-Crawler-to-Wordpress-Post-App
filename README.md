# Full-Stack-News-Crawler-to-Wordpress-Post-App
This is a Full-Stack News Crawler. You can give a News URL and upload pictures of your choice and a language of your choice. The program posts a full Wordpress post, with translated title, content, excerpt and keywords, with a thumbnail and other two pictures as a draft into your Wordpress page

The backend is fully written in Python, the frontend was created using Eel, HTML and Javascript. I created the index.html from scratch, only the animation was copied from another free template.

To start the App, Python is needed and some requirements are needed too.

In the repository you find the Juypter Notebook-file, the python-file and the overall HTML page with its needed resources. The App can be started through Jupyter Notebook or by just starting the Python file.

This Project was a challenge I gave myself, since I read about the high demand on webcrawlers. I am a side-reporter myself (I work for a news magazine) and with this app I could easily get News from another languages and translate them into mine and rewrite them again and post it on my website. Source will still be given, and as the programm created the post, the given URL will be written under the contents.

For a full documentation, have a look at my Webiste (link will follow)

There might be a issue, even though the main aspects are working succesfully. If you still encounter some issues, please let me know, and I will try to fix them. Known issues I could not fix by now, will be listed underneath:

Known Issues:
1. In the App, if an Error encounters, the button does't show the error, even if its written in the javascript, that it should do that
